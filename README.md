# exam-twin-readiness-engine
Designed and prototyped “Exam Twin,” a behavioral readiness engine that predicts exam preparedness and guides students toward optimal test timing using risk detection, constraint-based scoring, and decision nudges.
🚀 **Exam Twin — Behavioral Readiness Engine**

Exam Twin is a decision-intelligence prototype designed to help test-prep students answer a critical question:

“If my exam were today — am I ready?”

Unlike traditional preparation platforms that optimize for content consumption, Exam Twin focuses on exam preparedness and decision clarity.

🎯 **Problem**

- Students preparing for high-stakes exams often struggle with:

- Uncertainty about readiness

- Poor exam timing decisions

- Overconfidence or unnecessary delays

- Lack of unified performance insight

- This gap can lead to missed university deadlines or suboptimal scores.

💡 **Solution**

Exam Twin converts preparation signals into a directional readiness score and surfaces actionable insights such as:

✅ Weakest skill constraints
✅ Risk of missing target band
✅ Momentum trends
✅ Confidence levels
✅ Next-best actions

The system is designed as a behavioral nudge engine, not just a tracker.

🧠 **Product Thinking**

Instead of asking: “How much have you studied?”

Exam Twin asks: “Are you actually ready?”

This reframing shifts the platform from activity monitoring → decision intelligence.

⚙️ **Key Features**

- Constraint-based band prediction

- Readiness scoring

- Risk detection

- Exam countdown psychology

- Behavioral recommendations

- Preparation momentum visualization

🛠 **Tech Stack**

- Streamlit

- Plotly

- Python

🔮 **If Built at Scale**

Future iterations could include:

- ML-driven readiness modeling

- Personalized study plans

- Counselor alerts

- Adaptive exam scheduling

- Speaking-analysis AI
