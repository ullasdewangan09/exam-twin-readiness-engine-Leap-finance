# 🚀 Exam Twin — Behavioral Readiness Engine for Test Prep Students

Designed and prototyped **Exam Twin**, a behavioral readiness engine that predicts exam preparedness and guides students toward optimal test timing using risk detection, constraint-based scoring, and decision nudges.

---

## 🧠 From Activity Tracking → Decision Intelligence

Traditional test-prep platforms optimize for **content consumption**.

Exam Twin optimizes for **decision clarity.**

It helps students answer one critical question:

> **“If my exam were today — am I ready?”**

---

## 🎯 Problem

Students preparing for high-stakes exams often struggle with:

- Uncertainty about readiness  
- Poor exam timing decisions  
- Overconfidence or unnecessary delays  
- Lack of unified performance insight  

This gap can lead to missed university deadlines or suboptimal scores.

---

## 💡 Solution

Exam Twin converts fragmented preparation signals into a **directional readiness score** and surfaces actionable insights such as:

✅ Weakest skill constraints  
✅ Risk of missing target band  
✅ Momentum trends  
✅ Confidence levels  
✅ Next-best actions  

The system is designed as a **behavioral nudge engine**, not just a tracker.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Constraint-based band prediction  
- Readiness scoring  
- Risk detection  
- Exam countdown psychology  
- Behavioral recommendations  
- Preparation momentum visualization  

---

## 🧠 Product Thinking

Instead of asking:

> “How much have you studied?”

Exam Twin asks:

> **“Are you actually ready?”**

This reframing shifts the platform from **activity monitoring → decision intelligence**, reducing student uncertainty and enabling smarter exam planning.

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs & Design Decisions

A simplified scoring model improves interpretability and user trust but may reduce predictive precision compared to fully ML-driven systems.

The prototype prioritizes **clarity, actionability, and behavioral impact** over algorithmic complexity.

---

## 🔮 If Built at Scale

Future iterations could include:

- ML-driven readiness modeling  
- Personalized study plans  
- Counselor alerts for at-risk students  
- Adaptive exam scheduling  
- AI-powered speaking analysis
